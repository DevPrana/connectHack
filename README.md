### Potential Future Ideas
- AI/ML:
    - Zero shot classification on the abels such as job titles and skill, we can then extract the label percentages and set a certain minimum


#### Authentication
It helps a service understand who the user is, in most cases we pass our credentials to a server through the `Authorization header` or a custom header defined by the service we are trying to access.<br>
When we use request.get/post and specify an auth parameter (tuple consisting of username and password) requests is applying the credentials using HTTPâ€™s Basic access authentication scheme under the hood. Hence we can use the http basic auth scheme ourself to create an authorizations object like `authentication = HTTPBasicAuth(credentials['username'], credentials['password'])`.

#### Zero shot learning
ZSL moslty refers to very specific type of task that is learning a classifier on 1 set of labels and then evaluating on a different set of labels the model has never seen before. We will be using this in our case as well where for every repository a person has we will generate a list of candidate labels and calculate their probabilites. 
Any candidate label above the baseline probability will be accpeted as the skill of the person. (our default baseline baseline is: )
